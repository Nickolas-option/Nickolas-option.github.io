# Nickolas Option Portfolio

A sleek single-page personal website built with semantic HTML and modern CSS. It highlights key sections like an about blurb, project showcase, and contact form while keeping performance and accessibility in mind.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or use a simple static server:

```bash
npx serve
```

## Customization

- Update the text content in `index.html` to reflect your own story and work.
- Adjust the color palette, typography, or layout in `styles.css` to match your brand.
- Replace social links in the footer with your real profiles.
